# Gabrielle Ouellette: portfolio

A static website (plain HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of JavaScript). No build step, no installs.

## Put it online with GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub. Name it `YOUR-USERNAME.github.io` for a clean address, or anything else (for example `portfolio`).
2. Upload everything in this folder to the repository (drag the files and folders into GitHub's "Add file > Upload files" screen). `index.html` must be at the top level.
3. Go to **Settings > Pages**. Under **Build and deployment**, choose **Deploy from a branch**, pick the `main` branch and the `/ (root)` folder, then save.
4. After a minute or two, your site is live at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/` (or `.../portfolio/` if you used another name).

## Things to fill in

- **Your photo:** save it as `assets/gabrielle.jpg` (a portrait, roughly 4:5). Until then the page shows your initials.
- **LinkedIn and GitHub links:** search `index.html` for `your-linkedin-name` and `your-github-username` and replace them.
- **Project photos and results:** each page in `projects/` has a comment starting with `EDIT:` showing where to add a photo or extra detail.
- **Resume:** `assets/Gabrielle_Ouellette_Resume.pdf` is a copy of your resume. Replace it with a new file of the same name whenever you update it.

## Adding another project

1. Copy any file in `projects/` and rename it (for example `my-new-project.html`).
2. Edit the title, summary, facts, and text.
3. Add a new entry to the project list in `index.html`, copying an existing `<li class="project">` block.
